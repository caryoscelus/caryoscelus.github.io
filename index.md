Hello, wanderer!

If you're first-time visitor, let me introduce myself: i am *caryoscelus*,
<del>an artificial construct of someone's mind somewhere on the other end of the
net</del> well, never mind that, lets settle for *just* caryoscelus.

And now, without further ado, welcome to this (un)humble lair of mine! I would
want to say "make yourself comfortable and look around", but unfortunately
there's not that much to look at. You can check out [blog][blog] or
[projects][projects], however.

If you want to contact me for something *really important*, better not try to do
that via comment form bellow because it has no notifications. Just use email.
It's [caryoscelus@gmx.com][mail]. Otherwise, you still have a chance to be the
first to leave a meaningful comment here ^_^
