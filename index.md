hello, wanderer!

if you're first-time visitor, let me introduce myself: i am *caryoscelus*,
<del>an artificial construct of someone's mind somewhere on the other end of the
net</del> well, never mind that, lets settle for *just* [caryoscelus][contacts].

some people know me as a network entity, some as an artist, some as a person. i am
*caryoscelus*.

and now, with this very further ado, welcome to this (un)humble lair
and/or museum of mine! i would want to say "make yourself comfortable
and look around", but i already said it. this site (as you might've
noticed) is chronically lacking attention (on both sides). you can
check out [blog][blog] or any link from the top you like, however.
