Hello, wanderer!

If you're first-time visitor, let me introduce myself: i am *caryoscelus*,
<del>an artificial construct of someone's mind somewhere on the other end of the
net</del> well, never mind that, lets settle for *just* caryoscelus.

And now, without further ado, welcome to this (un)humble lair of mine! I would
want to say "make yourself comfortable and look around", but unfortunately
there's not that much to look at. This site is chronically lacking attention
(on both sides). You can check out [blog][blog] or [projects][projects],
however.

If you want to contact me for something *really important*, better not try to do
that via comment form bellow because it has no notifications. Refer to
[contacts page][contacts] instead. Otherwise, you still have a chance to be the
first to leave a meaningful comment here `^_^` The offer is limited!

[projects]:     /projects/
[contacts]:     /contacts/
