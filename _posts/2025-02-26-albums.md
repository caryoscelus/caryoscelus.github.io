so apparently i've released a few albums back when i was hiding mostly
offline and licking wounds. and apparently i'm in a mood to send
another "letter" to my mostly-not-proved-to-exist readers `^_^`

<cut/>

(TODO: insert covers, check links)

thus here's a short (re/over)view of:

[rec!][rec] signifies or simply records the collective improvisational
aspect

[41][41] is my 41st *published* (though not necessarily *made*
whatever that means) album. As if to signify my shift towards live
noise-y improvisations, it consists precisely of that; some piano,
some acoustic guitar

[noice winter after non][noice] was made as a live (coding) jam for
1.5 listeners, in the same location as well-known [music for no one at
dawn vol.1][at-dawn-1]. harsh, electronic noise made out of
one-too-many oscillators. mixes well with nature sounds, eccentric
drums or some such. Can be tasted on its own just as well

[self.report 0][self-report] now in real winter recorded thoughts in
an improvised acoustic gonzo-docu-noise-opera about digital
detox. huh, is it not out yet?  not my problem, it will likely up soon
