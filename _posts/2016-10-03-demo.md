As i mentioned before, i've been working on Synfig lately. And here's a little
demo of the Time Patching feature, which is the most interesting thing of what
i am doing.

Bah, no video support!

Yeah, i know: there's not much interesting you can see here. Because all the
good stuff lies in how it was made. Don't worry, i'm going to upload a video
demonstrating how it works soon. (Researching a best way to annotate video take
some time..)

If you are interested, you can download source [synfig files][files] and check
out [time patch development branch][branch]. (You won't be able to load those
files using unpatched Synfig version)
