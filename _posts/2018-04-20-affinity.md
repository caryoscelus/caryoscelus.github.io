Perhaps trivial for anyone who studied phonetic linguistics, but i just (at the
moment of writing, not publishing..) noticed that cursing words starting with
sh-like (and to, lesser degree, s-like and ch-like; i couldn't find example for
ts-like, perhaps it's too far) sounds are more appealing.

<cut/>

Here's an incomplete list for fun:

- ちくしょう (畜生), くそ (糞)
- 씨발
- shit, shrink, shmuck
- чёрт, пшёл, сука (also somewhat obsolete: шельма, шалава)
- Schwein, scheißen

For some reason many popular russian and english curses are on the contrary
abrupt and unappealing. Maybe that's why people have to invent three storey
cursing?..
