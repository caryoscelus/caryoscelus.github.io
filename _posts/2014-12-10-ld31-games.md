This isn't a proper review, but just a list of games i find interesting, for one
reason or another. If after playing some of them, you have a strong feeling your
(or not your, doesn't really matter) game deserves to be take a place here, feel
free to mention it.

NOTE: This entry will be updated as i find more interesting stuff.

<cut />

(there is no particular order)

* [Council of Smiles][smiles] - short, but kind of interesting
* [Ab Intra][intra] - nice little horror
* [entropy][entropy] - secret agents
* [My Weekend in Front of a Screen][weekend] - optimistic and humorous LD story
* [Colony Planner][colony] - a game by my Transient teammates ;)
* [Chess Chatter][chess] - oh wait, that's my game! what is it doing here?
* [$2000-$3fff][c64] - couldn't play it yet, but well, it's COMMODORE game! enough to mention
