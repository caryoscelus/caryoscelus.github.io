Have you ever felt a need for human connection, approval of your worthiness from
people you care about? Or even something as simple as recognizing your
existance, perhaps? Depending on whose opinion you care about, nowdays it can be
as easy as a single mouse click!

Read on for details on this revolutionary "free to pay" system.

Capitalism hasn't fully won on every territory on Earth, but luckily here on the
internets, it mostly did. The days of overly complex manually processed
unmanaged barter are over; open market with single convertible currency
liberates everyone from the burden of having to care about every aspect of
life. Just do your job well and let other professionals take care of your needs.

And unlike boring twentieth century where you had to lie on the couch going
through analysis, now you have a choice to pay those who you personally admire
and get their approval in return.

Finally, the dream of justice and equality for all (so often failed by
"socialists") is being implemented. Being weak, stupid or simply narrow-minded
is ok now. As long as you keep working for the benefit of society, society will
always support you back for a more than reasonable price.
