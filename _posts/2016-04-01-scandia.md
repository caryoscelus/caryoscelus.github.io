Without any particular (except for the obvious) reason, i've chosen today to
officially launch my new project: [scandia letters][scandia] (or *письма
скандии* in
russian, in which it is being written). Why yet another new project? Well,
because i tend to extend and inflate any project i start. But this one is a
series, which makes it easier to follow deadline and actually publish
*something*.

Since it is started, you can now expect more posts here, official announcement
on [lemmasoft forum][lemmasoft] <del>and perhaps a bit of downtime if github
servers would be unable to handle all the sudden traffic</del> (just wanted to
insert some unfunny joke here, sorry).

The first episode (currently in russian only, but english translation will
follow) is available [here][source]. Currently you need to have Ren'Py launcher
to run it, since i'm doing this in a rush, but more user-friendly release is to
be made soon.
