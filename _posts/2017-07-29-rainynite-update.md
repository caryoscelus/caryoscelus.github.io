So it's been a long time since my last post again; i guess i just can't make a
habit of regular updates.

In the meantime, there were three RainyNite "releases" and i'm preparing next
one (all planned features are already there, but i need a new cover image).

For now, have a screenshot:

I'll also upload some screencasts when 0.4 is out.
