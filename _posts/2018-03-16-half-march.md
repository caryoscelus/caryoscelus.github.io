<cut/>

- RainyNite 0.9 will be delayed since i don't spend enough time on it.. but it
  will still come out along with the new animation short

- i'm waiting for 22222 and then will start publishing

- surprisingly to myself, my 0net site is now available via
  [caryoscelus.bit](http://127.0.0.1:43110/caryoscelus.bit) address; not because
  i won against my laziness though, but thanks to ZAlex, who registered it

- again, somewhat surprisingly, i'm still writing regularly here

- now it can be officially mentioned that i'm not participating in nanoreno this
  year

- i took liking in Elm, but haven't started coding in it yet - npm/node.js is
  terrible (as can be expected from "js community")

- i started process of publishing sources of my old music (on request from
  ZAlex); for now, a few compositions lie
  [here](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1FiHm91tcDdjkiGkHZH2xoMc7Qmzrh8sv3/) in 0net

- porting to 0net will slowly continue; first priority is, of course, porting
  eucalyptus
