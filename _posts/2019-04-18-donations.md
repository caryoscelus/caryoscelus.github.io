Yesterday i started writing a pretentious post with the same meaning, but i
didn't like it, so here's a shorter, drier, less literary and more to the point
version:

<cut/>

- i'm looking for donations to sustain my physical (i don't like term "real" in
  this context) life

- there's **no emergency**, i can live without income for a while longer; and it
  shouldn't be that hard to find some freelance stuff either

- there are **no rewards** (besides however you may feel about donating): it
  would be an exchange otherwise; you can always try to hire me instead, if
  that's what you are looking for; i may start looking for more targeted
  donations in the future, if i decide that would be ok and more effective

- [please consider alternatives]({{ base_url }}{% post_url 2019-04-06-before-donating %})

- to sum it all up: i don't need money that badly yet, so i want to continue
  being as uninfluenced by them as possible; i don't want any conflicts or
  broken hopes arising from it either; and i don't want people who don't donate
  for *any reason* to feel like they are being left out

And with that out of the way, here's the [link](/donate/) with some technical
details.
