This blog might seem a little bit deserted lately, after a brief surge of
activity in some not-so-distant-yet past. The main reason for this is, as usual,
that i'm "busy" with activities in other places; in particular, a lot of
blog-like stuff can be found on "micro-blogging"
[「0me」](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1MeFqFfFFGQfa1J3gJyYYUvb5Lksczq7nH/?Profile/1White24UrrwQrD86o6Vrc1apgZ1x1o51/13oRBYqNeUr6Tvgt4KkAT9FT4XRiKFBjnE/caryoscelus@zeroid.bit)
platform (ZeroNet-only link). But let me post a brief update here, as well.

<cut/>

Somehow it's october already, and after-half of it too. Some of my wandering
thoughts are now finding their place in the
[Ramblings on the Road](http://127.0.0.1:43110/15rbLxi3UfTUoV9E6EUbZySSotdYv9w5sK/)
— the title pretty much says it all, it's literally me talking on record while
walking somewhere. My fictional writing has been looking for more inspiration
lately, but i'm sitting on a few few-KW (*) short stories just waiting to be
finished, and planing to write a planned out novel in november too.

(*) that's KiloWords, not power

After a streak of publishing a track per day somewhere in what i refer to as
"late summer", i didn't have time or energy to work on music as much, but i'm
slowly returning there, and might even finish a few albums consecutively since
i'm working in several direction as usual.

What's bothering me a little more is that i've returned to the kind of
perfectionist state of mind about my video making and there haven't been an
upload in a while, despite i had at least three working ideas, in different
stages of completion.

And then there's "life".. life's going on as usual and i'll cut the
so-very-cute-but-overused-metaphors about it. Not that i have to say anything in
particular, anyway.

And there you have it, a non-empty blog post out of the blue.
