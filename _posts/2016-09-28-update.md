It's been a while since i updated this blog and/or site, but lots of awesome
stuff is going to happen soon nevertheless.

<cut/>

- i made an [LD 36 entry][ld] and [working on it][sc] - playable version is to
  be made asap

- scandia letters is in limbo, but i'm going to work on its soundtrack pretty
  soon and then publish big chunk of SL

- i've been hacking [Synfig][synfig] and already getting some nice results; when
  my ultimate goal is reached, i'll be doing some animations with it
