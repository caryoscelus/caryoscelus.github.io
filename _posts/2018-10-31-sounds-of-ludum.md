I guess today is as good as any to make few final things about my "third" album:
namely, make a cover (which i already did), encode and publish it.
[Here it is](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1FiHm91tcDdjkiGkHZH2xoMc7Qmzrh8sv3/sounds-of-ludum/).

Yes, as you may have noticed it's currently available only via ZeroNet. I might
put it onto clearnet resources at some point later, if i'm not lazy. But then i
don't even know where: for *some reason* i don't like adding binary files to git
all that much; for another, i don't know good music platforms.

As for music itself, it's not really something new. I simply decided to finally
put together all (unless it's been on my first album) the music i've been doing
for games throughout my ludum dare days. I've added a couple touches here and
there for this release and arranged tracks in an order that seemed appropriate.
That's all. However, you probably haven't heard it before this post anyways.
