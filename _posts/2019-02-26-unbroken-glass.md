My second noise album is out (listen to it on
[0net](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1FiHm91tcDdjkiGkHZH2xoMc7Qmzrh8sv3/unbroken-glass-and-other-stories/) or
[mirror](https://0net.io/1FiHm91tcDdjkiGkHZH2xoMc7Qmzrh8sv3/unbroken-glass-and-other-stories/)). As
with the previous, it mostly consists of special or random sound recordings with
effects thrown on top, though this time there is more editing (culminating in
"abstracting away" track which is fully composed from recording pieces). Next
will probably develop further into this direction, although i think i have even
more ideas. Meanwhile, i may put together something more conventional.
