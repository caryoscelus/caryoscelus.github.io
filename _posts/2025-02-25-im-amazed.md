normies with a 5*8 job, with enough energy to socialize and post in
public

<cut/>

it took me being trapped in a snow storm away from civilization to
finish one blog post after years of silence; i can't socialize off-
and on-line at the same time; i long-press "backspace" (or just "back"
as is written on this very keyboard) more than 90% of the time i'm
starting to write a comment that would enter me into a public
discussion on the internet; i remove myself from discussions barely a
dozen replies in.

#### by constrast,

you do all those things, have a stable normal job and stable mental
life and are in trend with tomorrow's popular short videos. YOU ARE
AWESOME. so much energy, so beautifully wasted.

#### and so i only have to wonder,

if perhaps you are capable of wasting all that precious energy just
precisely because of that simple lifestyle of not choosing beyond
choice of words to choose from, and even that once in a blue saturday?
or because you are inherently so much stronger? in other words, is it
cosmic irony or cosmic injustice?

#### know

simple as that

absurd as this

### i

## log out
