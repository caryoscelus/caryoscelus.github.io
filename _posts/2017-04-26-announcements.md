1) I participated in [LD38][ld38] and took part in creating [this game][game].

2) RainyNite source is published [here][rainynite]. I know i should put build
instructions there. Will do that soon.

3) I have ZeroMe account now (caryoscelus@zeroid.bit). Not sure how much i'll be
using it, but expect more ZeroNet news from me anyway.
