So, another month is over, and i haven't been touching this blog. There could've
a lot i could write about, probably. But the short things went into 0me, and the
long ones.. just didn't get to be written.

<cut/>

Something went wrong and i didn't have any video ideas i'd like enough; the one
movie i've started earlier i almost didn't touch either. Much less the other
one. I do have an idea now, but it's too late for july.

Having barely finished june's album, i've started to work on another one, or
rather just a very long track (currently >12min and contemplating whether i
should be wrapping it up or continue it to the "full length"). Making another
vocal song, too.

I've also started to look into getting some VN-related work (writing soundtracks
is my favourite, though), but considering my conditions (of course, i'll only
contribute to libre software & culture works) it's unlikely i'm going to get
much offers. To increase chances i'm making a demo now. With the theme, length
and style i've chosen, i might be able to complete it this time.

Oh, and by the way i might be also interested in working on some libre software.

Another thing i'm contemplating is (as you might've inferred from my 0me posts)
rewriting parts of 0net to resolve some of its problems. Originally i wanted to
write a big post about my (not necessary all original, but the ones i share)
ideas, but didn't finish it. Maybe i'll collect those shorter ones and compile
into a big one here? Who knows..

And.. that's about it? There were, of course, other things happening here and
there, but i'm not ready to make a 180 in this blog just yet.
