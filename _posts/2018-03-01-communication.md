While i won't claim that to be absolute truth, i think many might find it
interesting to consider.

<cut/>

The reasoning is as follows:

1. you can only feel lonely in comparison to being (or conceptualizing) unlonely

2. communicating with more people will lead to each bit of communication
   capturing less of you

3. communicating more with a single person will lead to worse backfire when they
   fail to communicate with you (either by not being there or failing to
   understand)
