Writing 13 [TET][tet] music turned out to be easier than i thought.

<cut/>

Here's a short fragment i'm currently working on:

<audio controls><source src="/music/2016.11.10-13tet_r1.ogg"/></audio>

Note that it might sound odd or out of tune, especially if you've never heard
micro-tonal music. But rest asured, it's perfectly tuned using 13 equally
tempered tones per octave.
