It occured to me that "non-commercial" clause in CC licenses can have two
different (almost opposite) motivations.

<cut/>

1. "if you want to profit off my work, you'll have to pay me as well"

2. "nobody should profit off my work (including author)"

There is of course some middle ground between these options (such as: "i'd like
to choose on which conditions my work can be used commercially"), but it is
kinda ironic that the same license can be choosen (over non-nc alternative) by
people with completely different goals and ultimately even opposite world views.

Nearly the same reasoning can apply to "no derivatives" clause, but this is
beyond the scope of this little side note.
