I don't exactly like new year and especially the typical ways to celebrate it,
but being latent conformist i can't just watch others enjoy themselves without
either joining or being annoyed. Thus i tend to think up alternative ways to
celebrate. This year i'm going to do a writing challenge.

<cut/>

Originally, i wanted to make it a kind of writing jam and perhaps make it into a
big yearly event, but now i'm just not ready for that kind of organizing
activity. You're still welcome to join me, but otherwise i'm also fine doing by
myself.

The premise is simple: five stories in five days. Additional challenge: use as
much languages as possible. Level impossible: make each story at least 5KW.

Oh well, i better not make up any more of these additionals. The challenge
starts in a couple hours.
