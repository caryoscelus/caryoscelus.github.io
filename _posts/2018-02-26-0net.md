There are still a few things to polish, but it [mostly works](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1MCoA8rQHhwu4LY2t2aabqcGSRqrL8uf2X/).

Which means that the era of that weird comment system employed on this page is
coming to an end: since it was never quite used and incompatible with ssl, i'll
put it down right after adding commenting capability to 0net version.
