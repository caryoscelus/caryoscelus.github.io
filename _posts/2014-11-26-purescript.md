In search for something better than raw JavaScript which i used as fast
solution, i found out about PureScript - "small strongly typed programming
language that compiles to JavaScript" as described on it's [site][purescript].
It's highly inspired by Haskell (and written in it) which already means it's
pretty good. Not sure if it's better than some Haskell-to-JS solution, but i'm
giving it a try with [new comment-anything frontend][ca-fp].
