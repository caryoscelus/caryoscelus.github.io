It's been a while since the first post in this supposed series. Now I
feel like I have more to say on the subject.

<cut />

Why I feel paranoia? It's pretty simple: I know that my existence and
behaviour is making some people very uncomfortable. If they had their
say in it, a lot of them would erase me for sure without so much as
second thought (*). The reason they still haven't? It has more to do
with both amount of my importance to them and amount of resources they
have at their disposal.

First, they don't see enough of me to become obsessed with my
extermination — they express their discomfort via social pressure and
occasional acts of violence. They don't feel as though I'm a huge
threat so taking drastic actions seems unwarranted (for those who even
have a capacity to assess situation logically).

And on the other hand even if it's perfectly plausible for them to
build a conspiracy against me, they are just not as smart individually
to pull it off effortlessly. Because of the first reason most of them
don't even start to bother mounting *any kind of effort* against
me. And those few who do tend to actually go through with it — they
are either smart enough to realize it isn't worth the benefits; or
they are dumb enough to spend time obsessing over fantasies that don't
form a coherent plan.

What makes me afraid then? First of all, their numbers. In current
state of affairs there are simply more of them. Much more. Second of
all, their *potential for intellect*. Having myself the capacity to
enact a perfect plan against me makes me scared that they would be
interested and capable of doing so.

Luckily, as I mentioned above, they tend to be inherently less
capable: after all, my only sin is being different and if their
intellect is weak enough to hate me for it, it's also weak enough to
be able to create or follow the plan. The problem is, however, that
collective intelligence or collective physical strength are often
enough to overcome the gap in individual intelligence. And gathering
in collectives is what they do.

And right here we come to a sort of conclusion that perhaps may feel a
little underwhelming to some of you: to combat your paranoia one of
the best options is to build a community of likewise intelligent and
kind individuals and make it strong enough to protect its members from
the kinds of dangers you're afraid of.

See you in the next post in the series, *maybe*.
