Blogging, huh? Nobody reads these posts anyway, not really, in 2026, on a static
site, run on github.io, without fancy domain, seo optimizations, ads on
instagram, substack subscriptions.

<cut />

But then again, does it even matter? Ninety nine point god knows how many nines
percent of sentient beings' thoughts are never heard, in this material world,
anyway. {beware of double-entendre, well thought-out punctuation}. Does it mean
it was useless to think those thoughts? It would be an odd position to take,
even though many may still subscribe to it.

I initially thought to write about "AI", a post that could've laid bare-bones of
the future video. But I've been thinking about writing post in that general
direction for a while now, and the best that came out of it so far was a
[conceptual music album](https://caryoscelus.bandcamp.com/album/better-than-ai).
I always tend to have higher standards for blog-like texts already, having
thought about it for a while means they will be unbearably high. So I probably
couldn't write a satisfying post in one sitting. And chances of finishing in
more than one sitting are severely diminishing at this point.

So I'm writing this self-referential post instead. But then again (`*`), isn't
self-reference the only real building block of consciousness and reality? So it
must be ok to indulge in writing about writing. Everyone is unique. There is
only one though, really. It only makes sense to make your own rendition of that
thought that express the thought in a different way. Every step matters and you
never know your place in the world (i.e. "*how valuable do you think your
thoughts are?!*" cliche) until you interact with it. Also poking world be
fun. So here goes.

(`*`): then again, "then again" has become a parasitic word construction in my
writing

Stylishly abrupt, high-contrast abstract-versus-concrete mentality, poetically
absurd language. AI be bad — dashes are friend.
