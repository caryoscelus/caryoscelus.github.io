I've been searching for a perfect desktop setup for as long as i remember
using computer. KDE3, Gnome2, KDE4, switching from (then still) OpenOffice to
Kate for everything, drop-down terminal, excursions to *box and awesome, then
finally settling with 10-virtual-desktop layout and a handful of shortcuts.

<cut/>

Now's the time has come to move further, to the land of even better ergonomics.
And the first step is Emacs. I've been slowly moving towards it in the last few
weeks and now i'm writing this post in Emacs, running jekyll in terminal inside
Emacs and watching the "rendered" page in emacs-w3m (because eww was freezing
Emacs way too often).

Of course, Emacs is not perfect. It is great because of its large legacy (has a
tool for virtually everything), but its legacy also affects its useability in
some ways. To put it blunt: i don't like Lisp these days. And lack of
integration with some of the common desktop GNU/Linux can be daunting (such as
no shortcuts with non-latin ibus layout; out of the box, at least - maybe it can
be configured somehow).

At some point, perhaps, i'll have to look further, for a *truly silver* bullet
of computing. But for now it mostly feels nice to be switching from using a
bunch of tools with different interfaces and quirks to just one, fully
controllable with keyboard.
