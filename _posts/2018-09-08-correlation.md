Correlation does not imply causation, but they certainly can be
correlated. Measure of such correlation can then be used as a measure of
effectiveness of correlation studies. If we're to correlate this measure with
alternative measures in the same field, and then continue this process of higher
correlating ad finitum, what kind of knowledge can we obtain?
