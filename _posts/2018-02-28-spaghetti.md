**tl;dr** don't code in an ineffective way if you don't enjoy it

<cut/>

And so i did it again. Started coding in a language and paradigm that i don't
like. Because that would save time for more interesting stuff. Well, teh
surprise: it doesn't.

It is of course always a matter of balance between getting result fast and
getting perfect result, but js with some glued together libs simply does not
deliver fast result for seemingly trivial tasks.

At the end of the ~~day~~ month i do have a mostly working engine that i'm going
to keep until better times, but it would be more effective to learn proper
technologies first. But here's a problem: web development attracts nih syndrome
and coders with low standards to such a degree that it is hard to find the best
alternative out of thousands.

Well, i can't really solve that problem without wasting too much time on
something i don't care about, but i could at least pick a working frp framework.

Lets hope i'm more smart next time.
