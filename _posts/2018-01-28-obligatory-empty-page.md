Finally, i'm in the process of moving into [0net][wiki]. I had to start
somewhere and decided to create an [obligatory empty page][empty]. As the title
suggests, there's not much interesting there, but i'll be grateful if you'd seed
it so that if there are any technical issues i can solve them now instead of
dealing with them when publishing actual content.
