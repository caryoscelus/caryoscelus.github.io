There is a math proof technique called "forcing", but frankly i don't know what
it means. But coincidentally my secret writing technique #4 is also called
"forcing".

<cut/>

There is a common sense rule "don't force it if you can help" and it naturally
applies here. Forcing is a technique i don't especially like using. Usually it
works as a last resort measure, when the plot is stuck and cannot move an inch
without heaving pushing.

Forcing boils down to reviewing already established events, characters, their
motivation etc — essentially everything that you've written so far — and then
considering logical possibilities for the yet unfilled blanks. There is always a
question waiting to be answered: whether it's as simple as "what happened
between day one and day X?", or as elaborate as "what was the reason behind that
suspicious smile back on page 1?" — until you've finished the story (and even
then), you can always find something.

Some questions are better than others; some are enough to make a breakthrough
and some can only be a piece in a larger puzzle. Just collect the questions and
possible answers and ~~perform exhaustive prediction of each combination~~ pick
something that you are comfortable with.

Sounds simple on screen, so i'm off to do that now.
