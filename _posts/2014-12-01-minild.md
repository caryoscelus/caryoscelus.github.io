The game is [here][game]. It's text-only game in chat with some roguelike
influence. Not polished and probably quite boring.

Source code [here][code]. Mostly PureScript with helper sh+Python script. Note
that code is somewhat imperative and unsafe (e.g. everything related to random),
so large parts should be completely rewritten...

It's unlikely that i'll continue active development, unless there will be some
interest in it. But it was nice coding experience.
