Finally, eucalyptus becomes official part of the site. Unfortunately, with
duct-tape HydeView engine i can't link to it normally, so for now there are two
links:

- [clearnet](/eucalyptus-ff)
- <a href="/" onclick="page.initialize('eucalyptus/')">0net</a>

<cut/>

Oh yeah, i still remember about 22222 promise and this is in part preparation
for that. I'm running late as usual, but gotta make everything right, you know.

..Just joking. I'll never be able to make *everything* wright on the webs. But
who can, anyways? The web is broken.
