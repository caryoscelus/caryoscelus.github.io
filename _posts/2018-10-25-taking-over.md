Have you ever been in a situation when you wanted to raise your CLANG as usual,
but suddenly noticed strange reaction of people around you? Perhaps you'd been
climbing over the neighbouring hill to proudly waive your CLANG from this high
point, when you'd realize that people averting gazes, changing the side of the
street, or plainly stare at you with cold creepy eyes?..

<cut/>

Whether it was as dramatic or not, whether you were on receiving end or brought
it down yourself, if you have lived in society long enough, you probably had
witnessed this phenomenon. One might say that it's not even worth singling out
as something special, because in the end the CLANG was never really the CLANG
you meant it to be. And that's valid point from one perspective.

But the world is so full of ambiguity that having just one "ambiguity" category
for it doesn't seem to be enough. Taking over the CLANG isn't only a recurring
phenomenon, it's also one that can be (and thus most likely was) used
intentionally, the most obvious motive being destruction of whatever stood
behind said CLANG.

When this happens, does it make sense to continue using your stained CLANG,
explaining what you real mean on the way? Or to create a new CLANG and hope it
will work for a while? Or disregard society opinion or perhaps the whole concept
of CLANGs?

Or maybe you should at least stop treating people by the CLANG they use?
