Even if i'm not big fan of new year concept, there's still one thing i really
wanted to do "this year": migrate away from the old rotten centralized web into
something better, or, at the very least, start such migration.

However, since i'm constantly postponing any efforts in this direction, the only
thing i can actually get done before 2018 unleashes on us is start cross-posting
into ZeroMe.

So, [here it is][zerome].
