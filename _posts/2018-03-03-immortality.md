After spending years of my youth on contemplating immortality, i came to a
simple conclusion: for any *meaningful* definition of immortality that is worth
achieving, it is impossible to *achieve* immortality. In other words, if
definition of immortality has something in common with common sense
understanding of the word *and* it looks like a desirable state, every entity
either *is inherently immortal* or *will never be*.
