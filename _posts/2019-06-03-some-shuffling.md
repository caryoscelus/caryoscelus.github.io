(if you're not reading this from ZeroNet, it probably doesn't concern you)

Today i finally finished what i had better done much earlier: separated out my
literature zites from the main one.

<cut/>

There's some minor issue, but in general it's much better to have them separate,
for two reasons:

- my poor engine does not support direct links for "subsites"

- with all the files signing process becomes a little uncomfortable, and may
  even create unnecessary traffic

Initial reason to make subsites at all was to avoid "no peers" issue, but
nowdays i feel that shouldn't be a big problem.

Here are new links (also changed them already in [txt](/txt), though i did not
remove actual files yet):

- [eucalyptus (short stories)](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1JecUbTPHudVR3fi6KMFwQNW2mT2L8H7dq/)
- [heavy bright sun](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1HAB57aQRcLHoHb3ehHrh8SZT647VWVA28/)
- [poetry](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1QDEpSBxTXiZ4ak9m9ATAVAy1SSLiRrxKs/)

Considering the content, it might've been a better idea to write this post in
russian, but then again, who even cares?..
