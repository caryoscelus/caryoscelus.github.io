About
-----

So, you wonder what is this all about and who is this *caryoscelus* person?

Well, not so fast! I do realize the time to put at least something on this
lonely page has come, but that doesn't mean i'm going to write a life story or
explain structure of the universe in lame (sic!) terms.

Instead, i'll write whatever i see fit for the purposes of this site. Which are,
by the way, mostly publishing my works and occasionally posting random stuff.

And here is a nice point to mention which kind of works are those: in fact, they
can range from code and music to fiction and graphics. Sometimes (or maybe even
more often than not) those get together resulting in some kind of interactive
story. Unfortunately i hadn't been very persistent with most of my projects and
so they remain in "in-progress" state.

On a completely unrelated note: i'm a stubborn idealist (not in materialist vs
idealist sense, that's a question for a different story) and try to live by my
principles. Call me fanatic if you like, but i won't take as an insult: the word
was used to describe too much great people that don't have much in common with
uncritical believers it used to describe.

Perhaps it is worth to mention linguistical matters and specifically my current
fluency in various languages. There's not much to it, though cause except for
english i'm only fluent in russian (мой родной язык, вообще-то). All my other
limited language knowledge isn't worth mentioning except for [lojban][lojban]
{.uecai coi lo jbopre poi tcidu dei}. Despite i am worse at it than, say, at
spoken japanese, it is too interesting and cool to omit the chance to advertise
it.

That'll be all for now. Just keep reading blog.

And, of course, feel free to [contact me](/contacts/).
