About
-----

So, you wonder what is this all about and who is this *caryoscelus*
person? Or/if/whether person at all?

Well, not so fast! I do realize the time to put at least something on this
lonely page has come, but that doesn't mean i'm going to write a life story or
explain structure of the universe in lame (sic!) terms.

Instead, i'll write whatever i see fit for the purposes of this site.

Since this site is currently being under almost-ddos attack by new visitors,
i'll mention that i'm libre software and open culture proponent and thought
about that as of a well-established fact not worth mentioning here, until those
hordes of visitors (bots?) came.

Reliable sociology shows that you're highly likely to be smarter than average.
But if you think you've found a contradiction in me, you're about 99% likely to
be mistaken in one of your premises. If you happen to land in that 1%, i'll be
very happy to discuss that issue with you. (Cheers)

That'll be all for now. Just keep reading blog.
