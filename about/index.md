'bout
-----

so, you wonder what is this all about and who is this *caryoscelus*
person? or/if/whether person at all?

not so quickly! i'm going to write a life story or explain structure
of the universe in lame (sic!) terms here.

instead, i'll write whatever i see fit for the purposes of this site.

since this site is currently (again) under (almost) (d)dos (almost)
attack by (almost) new visitors, i'll mention that i'm libre software
and open culture proponent and thought about that as of a
well-established fact not worth mentioning here â€” until those hordes
of visitors (bots?) came, that is.

<this part was here, but now is being ~~censored~~ rewritten>

reliable sociology shows that you're highly likely to be smarter than average.
but if you think you've found a contradiction in me, you're about 99% likely to
be mistaken in one of your premises. if you happen to land in that 1%, i'll be
very happy to discuss that issue with you. (Cheers!)

that'll be all for now. just keep reading blog (again).

and, of course, feel free to [contact me](/contacts/).
