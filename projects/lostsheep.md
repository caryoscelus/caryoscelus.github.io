# lost sheep

Perhaps best way to describe its genre would be "interactive animated story" as

are somehow ( despite total lack of info ;) ) interested in joining, you're
welcome to contact me.

Oh, and if you wondering what does it look like, here's a little secret: current
site design is made after it.
