# lost sheep

Perhaps best way to describe its genre would be "interactive animated story" as
it has started as a visual novel, but soon became closer to animation.
Unfortunately, i don't have much of animation skills, so it progresses quite
slow. If you are somehow ( despite total lack of info ;) ) interested in joining
and skilled in [synfig][synfig], you are welcome to contact me.

Oh, and if you wondering what does it look like, here's a little secret: current
site design is made after it.
