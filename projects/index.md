# Projects

## Visual Novels

* lost sheep (most active development - used to be nanoreno 2015 project)
* [Playground: the Game of Scissors][playground] (active development)
* [The Day After][day-after] (not active, but not cancelled either; perhaps it will be
rewritten nearly from scratch when i finally get back to it)
* [Chess Chatter][chess] (not active due to team controversy)

## Other Games
Not much interesting and finished, actually.

You may check my [Ludum Dare page](http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/caryoscelus/).
Wait, that in fact mostly list those VNs i already mentioned. Well, you can
check [Transient Team LD page](http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/kibertoad/) as
well since i participated in many of those projects.

## Music
My first album: [meanwhile][meanwhile]

If you want any sources or better quality tracks, feel free to ask. I may
publish them at some point myself, but at the moment i'm not motivated enough to
bother.
