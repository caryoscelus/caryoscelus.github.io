# Music

I've been writing music for a while now, though i'm far from being able to do
exactly what i want. That's probably why i'm not always eager to publish every
track the moment i finish it. So, for now there are two albums available:

<table>
<tr>

<td>
<a href="https://www.jamendo.com/album/159939/taking-out-the-trash">
<img src="https://imgjam2.jamendo.com/albums/s159/159939/covers/1.200.jpg"/>
<br/>taking out the trash
</a>
</td>

<td>
<a href="https://www.jamendo.com/album/145855/meanwhile">
<img height="200" width="200" src="/images/something.png"/>
<br/>meanwhile
</a>
</td>

</tr>
</table>

Ah, there's one more thing: all my music is under CC-BY-SA license and you can
get its source for learning & editing. And of course it's made using only
free/libre software and samples.

At the moment i was too lazy to actually publish source, so you'll have to ask
for it.
