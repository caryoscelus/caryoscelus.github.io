# Music

I've been writing music for a while now, though i'm far from being able to do
exactly what i want. That's probably why i'm not always eager to publish every
track the moment i finish it. So, for now there are two albums available:

<table>
<tr>

<td>
<a href="https://www.jamendo.com/album/159939/taking-out-the-trash">
<img src="https://imgjam2.jamendo.com/albums/s159/159939/covers/1.200.jpg"/>
<br/>taking out the trash
</a>
</td>

<td>
<a href="https://www.jamendo.com/album/145855/meanwhile">
<img height="200" width="200" src="/images/something.png"/>
<br/>meanwhile
</a>
</td>

<td>
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:43110/1FiHm91tcDdjkiGkHZH2xoMc7Qmzrh8sv3/sounds-of-ludum/">
<img height="200" width="200" src="/images/sounds-of-ludum.jpg"/>
<br/>sounds of ludum
</a>
</td>

</tr>
</table>

Ah, there's one more thing: all my music is under CC-BY-SA license and you can
ask for source (although i can't guarantee i haven't lost it along the way).
And of course it's made using only free/libre software and samples.

Some of the sources are already [available on
ZeroNet](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1FiHm91tcDdjkiGkHZH2xoMc7Qmzrh8sv3/).
