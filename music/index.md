# Music

I've been writing music for a while now, though i'm far from being able to do
exactly what i want. That's probably why i'm not always eager to publish every
track the moment i finish it. So, for now there's just this lonely album
available:

<br/>meanwhile
</a>

Ah, there's one more thing: all my music is under CC-BY-SA license and you can
get its source for learning & editing. And of course it's made using only
free/libre software and samples.

At the moment i was too lazy to actually publish source, so you'll have to ask
for it.
